# school-project
This repository is a centralized archive of various school projects I have worked on. It consolidates multiple GitHub repositories into a single location for backup and reference purposes. 

Some projects in this archive include CI/CD configuration files. Please note that these pipelines are non-functional in this repository, as it serves solely as a static backup of past work.

Feel free to browse through the folders to explore different projects and their corresponding codebases.
