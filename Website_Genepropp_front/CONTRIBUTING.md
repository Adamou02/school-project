Guidelines
Add one link per Pull Request.
Make sure the PR title is in the format of [KEY]: [description]
Keep descriptions concise and short.
Add the section description if needed.
Search previous Pull Requests or Issues before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
Check your spelling and grammar.
Remove any trailing whitespace.
Just a gentle reminder: Try not to submit your own project. Instead, wait for someone finds it useful and submits it for you.
